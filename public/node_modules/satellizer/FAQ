**Note:** If for some reason you are unable to send a token to
your server in the following format - `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, then use
`$authProvider.authHeader` method to override this behavior, e.g. set its value to
**x-access-token** or another custom header that your backend may require.

## Not sending the JWT for specific requests 
```
// This request will NOT send the token as it has skipAuthentication
$http({
  url: '/api/endpoint',
  skipAuthorization: true
  method: 'GET'
});
```

## Updating storage
To toggle from localStorage and sessionStorage run `$auth.setStorage('sessionStorage');` or `$auth.setStorage('localStorage');`
