  "readme": "# Electron Cookies\n\n(Formerly called `atom-shell-cookies`)\n\nAdds support for cookies in Electron. Cookies are persisted through localStorage.\n\nForked from https://gist.github.com/paulcbetts/2d2de55d137a1cf9d1ac.\n\n## Why?\n\nElectron's `renderer` environment doesn't come with built in support for a `document.cookie` API. Thus, if you want to use Google Analytics or another client-side analytics library, they won't work because they can't set cookies.\n\nBy using this package, you can drop client-side analytics code into your app and it will work splendidly.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install electron-cookies\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your app's `renderer` code, just require this package:\n\n```js\nrequire('electron-cookies')\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nOriginal code is written in `src/index.coffee`, with tests at `spec/electron_cookies_spec.coffee`. Write code in coffeescript, and run `grunt` to compile coffeescript on the fly.\n",
